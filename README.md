## Time-Series-Applications_AMLD2022

[Time Series Applications Workshop](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-africa-2022/workshops/time-series-applications) at [AMLD Africa 2022](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-africa-2022).




### `Overview` >:  
The the workshop will focus on common time series algorithms from a theoretical and applied perspective, including ARIMA/singular spectrum analysis/recurrent neural networks for prediction, topological/geometric approaches for change-point detection, and longitudinal statistical models for statistical testing of factors influencing time series values. The applications will involve Python code and datasets.


### `Outcome` >: 
Participants will come away with some theoretical knowledge of time series data and techniques to model time series data, as well as knowledge of how to implement these techniques in Python.



### `Difficulty` >:  
Beginner level



### `Co-organizers` >:
